# Comment Replies:

  

The Manangos tip bot is intended for tipping small amounts on Reddit posts and replies.

  

  

On supported subreddits, you can send a tip like this:

  

  

`!Mango 1 `

  

  

This will tip a redditor 1 Manangos. !Mango <amount> must be the first thing in your message OR the last thing. Such, this is also a valid tip:

  

  

`It's like magic !Mango 1`

  

  

Or from anywhere on reddit, you can tip a commenter by mentioning the tip bot:

  

  

`/u/Manangostips 1`

  
  

  

If the subreddit is a friendly subreddit, the bot will respond with a message. If the subreddit is not friendly, a PM will be sent to both the sender and the recipient.

  

# Private Messages

  

  

The Manangos tip bot also works by PM. [Send a message](https://reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/u/Manangostips&subject=command&message=type_command_here) to /u/Manangostips for a variety of actions.

  

  

To send 1 Manangos to Angelscry74, include this text in the message body:

  

  

`send 1 !Mango`

  
  

  

To send 1 Manangos to Stellar address GBQU5Q3YQGC74RL6JGF2ZW5S4CJIPZH753WINCLI6FIZF47CY33OPDHA, include this text in the message body:

  

  

`send 1 GBQU5Q3YQGC74RL6JGF2ZW5S4CJIPZH753WINCLI6FIZF47CY33OPDHA`

  

  

or send all your balance:

  

  

`send all GBQU5Q3YQGC74RL6JGF2ZW5S4CJIPZH753WINCLI6FIZF47CY33OPDHA`

  

*Note that the address you are sending to must have a trustline with Manangos address on Stellar (GCAD56MX3VL4YE3KIXPOWOMHTQYJOPYP7UQUQ2CAJQV4NYZ3566CAGKM) and you cannot send from an exchange wallet.*

  

There are many other commands.

  

  

```
'balance' or 'address' - Retrieve your account balance.
'create' - Create a new account if one does not exist
'help' - Get this help message 
'history <optional: number of records>' - Retrieves tip bot commands.  
'send <amount or all, optional: Currency> <user/address>' - Send Manangos to a reddit user or an address  
'silence <yes/no>' - (default 'no') Prevents the bot from sending you tip notifications or tagging in posts  
'subreddit <subreddit> <'activate'/'deactivate'> <option>' - Subreddit Moderator Controls - Enabled Tipping on Your Sub (`silent`, `full`)  
'opt-out' - Disables your account.  
'opt-in' - Re-enables your account.
```

  

### Control tip bot Behavior on your subreddit

  

If you are a moderator of a subreddit, and would like to tipping to your sub, use the `subreddit` command. For example, to activate tipping on the r/Manangos subreddit, I send a PM to the bot saying:

  

  

`subreddit manangos activate`

  

  

This will allow the bot to look for !Mango commands and respond to posts in that subreddit.

  

-or- If I don't want the bot to respond, but still want tips:

  

  

`subreddit manangos activate silent`

  
  
  
  

  

To deactivate, simply PM

  

  

`subreddit manangos deactivate`

# Terms of Service

  

* Do not keep a lot of Manangos in your tip bot account! The tip bot is for tipping small amounts ONLY.

  

* You accept the risks of using this tip bot -- We won't steal your Manangos, but they might be lost at any point, and we are at no obligation to replace them. Don't put in more than you're willing to lose.

  

* We are under no obligation to provide support. The tip bot is not a custodial service.

  

* Any consequences of tipping are the responsibility of the users using this service.

  

* This software is provided "as is" and any express or implied warranties, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose are disclaimed. In no event shall the copyright holder or contributors be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, exemplary, or consequential damages (including, but not limited to, procurement of substitute goods or services; loss of use, data, or profits; or business interruption) however caused and on any theory of liability, whether in contract, strict liability, or tort (including negligence or otherwise) arising in any way out of the use of this software, even if advised of the possibility of such damage.

  

  

# FAQ

  

## Why does the message have to start or end with !Mango<amount>?

  

This is to prevent unintentional tips! If the program simply scanned the entire comment, a user might accidentally quote someone else's tip command in a response. In the future I might change this, but for now it's the best way to ensure the program behaves as expected.

  

  

## Are my funds safe?

  

**NO! Unless you and you alone control your private keys, your funds are never safe!** Please don't keep more than a small dose of Manangos on the tip bot at any time! **Use at your own risk!**

  
  
## What about fees?

  
Unfortunately, Stellar requires fees to send transactions. The tipping happens off-chain to circumvent this. However, the bot needs to pay a small amount of XLM at each withdrawal. 
You can prevent withdrawal problems and support the bot by donating a little XLM to the bot's address: 
GBOVBMRWWE7QNHSRCCBO3QM36VUJ3LRQ7GZH6UOQSRLWRUDWUZ5ALTNE.

  

## I sent a tip to the wrong address. Can I get it back?

  

If the address isn't affiliated with a Redditor, **No.**

  

  

## I sent a tip to the wrong redditor. Can I get it back?

  

Your best bet is to try to reach out to the redditor and ask for it back. Do not harass other redditors or do anything that would violate Reddit's Terms of Service.

  

  

## I tried to send a tip, but received no response. Did it go through?

  

Probably not. It's most likely the bot was temporarily disconnected. If a command is issued while the bot is offline, the command will not be seen. If no response is received from the bot after a few minutes, send a message to the bot with the text 'history'. If you get a response and the tip isn't in your history, that means it wasn't seen. If you don't get a response, the bot is probably still offline. Try again in a few minutes.

  

  

## I found a bug or I have a concern. Question Mark?

  

Post it on the [Manangos subreddit](https://reddit.com/r/Manangos) .

  

  

# Error Codes
